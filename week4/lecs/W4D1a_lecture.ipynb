They are convenient to express, but if we care about performance, they might be more expensive than we can afford, because they make a copy of the segment of the list denoted by the slice.\n","\n","We can still leverage the power of recursion though, by avoiding the slicing, and thinking in terms of the indices we are working with, in order to design the \"wishful thinking\" step. Some people refer to such a recursive function as a _helper_ function.  If you look closely enough, you will see similarities with the iterative solution.
