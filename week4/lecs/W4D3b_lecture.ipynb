    "Counting reachable nodes is the same thing as exploring, but we are also keeping track of a count.  In our discussion so far, we have limited ourselves to trees, which did not have cycles, so it was impossible to revisit the same node twice, if we started out on different out-neighbours from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a general graph, this will not be the case though.  It might be possible that if we start at one node, $u$, and explore from its first out-neighbour, we could get to some node $v$; and then later, when exploring from $u$'s second out-neighbour, we also get to the same node $v$.  If we counted reachable nodes in the way we did for trees, we would end up double counting $v$.  So, to avoid this, we have to keep track of a \"register\" of which nodes have already been visited.  We need to make sure that it is available to every recursive call, so that as it is updated, other recursive calls see those updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at our DFS implementation, we can see a strong similarity to the process for counting reachable nodes. The main difference is the existence of a record of the nodes that have been visited (the `visited` dictionary), which is passed to every recursive call.  Notice also that we consult that record to avoid making the recursive call at any out-neighbours that have already been accounted for (i.e. visited)."
