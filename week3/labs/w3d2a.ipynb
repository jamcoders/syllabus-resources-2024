We will see some examples of these in the days to come, and you might be surprised how elegant a recursive solution can be!\n","\n","Another main takeaway from recursion, is the problem solving strategy of breaking a big problem into smaller repetitive problems, which is a fundamental concept of computer science.\n","\n","It is hard, and you won‚Äôt get it right away, but all the TAs and lecturers are here to guide you through it!
