But there is yet another similarity: you can peel the palindrome layer by layer.\n","\n","For example: Suppose you wanted to check if `'racecar'` is a palindrome. You could look at the first and last letter, and if they are the same, recursively check the rest of the string to see if `'aceca'` is a palindrome.  You could keep on peeling away the first and last letters layer by layer until you have a single letter `e`, which is a palindrome.\n","\n","Just as we have done before, brainstorm the logic of the function below"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qCcv5zDB0xZt"},"outputs":[],"source":["# What are the base cases?\n","\n","# What are the recursive cases?\n","\n","# Write some tentative logic for how the code will work in words"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MC1QKdwO05kj"},"source":["Try to code the recursive function `is_palindrome(string)` that returns `True` if `string` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
